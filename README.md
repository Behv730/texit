# Texit
A Python script that reads .md files and outputs a .tex file containing equations and headings.
- \$\$ enclosed equations become \\[ equation \\]
- 1headings become \\sectiontitle{ 1heading}
- other headings become \\ sectionsubtitle{ other heading }

You can change what $LaTeX$ command wraps the headings and equations by modifying the script ofcourse.

## Additionally
I use Obsidian to take notes,
this script is useful in combination with my $LaTeX$ formula template. Behv730/LaTeX_Equations.
